# Game of Trees (Java)

ðŸ§  A two-player console-based word strategy game using Binary Search Trees and 2-3 Trees. Players load datasets into tree structures and score points by attacking, defending, or swapping word frequencies.

---

## ðŸŽ® Game Features

- Loads words from external files into BST or 2-3 Trees
- Players perform 3 actions: `attack`, `defend`, `swap`
- Randomized rounds and turn order
- Score tracking and word reuse prevention
- Tree comparisons and printing included

---

## ðŸ§© Structure

- `Player.java` â€” defines each playerâ€™s behavior and score
- `BST.java` â€” implementation of binary search tree
- `TwoThreeTree.java` â€” implementation of 2-3 Tree
- `GameTree.java` â€” shared interface for both trees
- `DaryaNikolayevaA4.java` â€” main game logic and loop

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- Java
- OOP principles (interfaces, recursion, tree traversal)
- File I/O and console input

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Designing complex systems with clear modular logic
- Tree-based data structures and gameplay design
- Implementing fair rules for frequency-based strategy
